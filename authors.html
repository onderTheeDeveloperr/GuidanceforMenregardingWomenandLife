              Many consider my work to be crude and unnecessarily confrontational. But I write the way I do because my goal is to challenge our cultural notions around emotions, vulnerability, shame, and sexuality. To do that effectively, sometimes
              you
              need to shock people or be contrarian.
            </p>
            <p>
              Life advice is most effective when it’s fun and unpretentious. Therefore, my goal is to entertain as well as sustain. To amuse as well as advise. To disseminate potentially life-changing information to millions in a way that is not only
              ethical and transparent, but at the same time, also hilarious.
